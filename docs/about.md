### OVERVIEW

SocialAuth is a popular authentication library for Java and Android. The power of SocialAuth lies in the facility
it provides to both an application's users and its developers. For users, it means pre-existing credentials can be
tapped to log in to an application and share content. For developers, it means the ability to authenticate users
with minimal development effort and transitive dependencies.

### MOTIVATION

The motivation behind creating SocialAuth was the need to have a reusable library for user authentication that worked across a number of different languages and platforms. Having been originally developed for Java web applications, SocialAuth has since been extended to Android, WordPress, and .NET. As users have an increasing number of connected accounts already, it has become imperative for products to allow users to sign in and use products without needing to create new accounts. If you've ever used Single sign-on, that's what SocialAuth provides.   

### THE VALUE OF SOCIALAUTH

SocialAuth provides value to end users, application developers, and site owners. The value of SocialAuth includes:

- The ability for users of a site or application to log in to a service using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, Yahoo, Instagram, and other popular services.
- Allows users to share status updates to multiple platforms at once.
- Ability for users to pull in contacts from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, Yahoo, and more.
- Allows users to send emails or text messages from native email and messaging clients.   

### TECHNOLOGY

There are two different versions of SocialAuth available. The original SocialAuth is written in Java for web applications. SocialAuth for Android is an Android version of the original Java library.
