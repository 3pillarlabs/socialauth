Socialauth
================

SocialAuth is a Java library ([.NET port](http://code.google.com/p/socialauth-net/) & [Android](http://code.google.com/p/socialauth-android/) version available) for you if your web application requires:

* Authenticating users through external oAuth providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MySpace, Salesforce, Yammer, Google Plus, Instagram as well as through OpenID providers like myopenid.com.
* Easy user registration. All you need to do is create a page where users can click on buttons for the above providers or other supported providers. Just call SocialAuth and you can get all their profile details.
* Importing contacts from networking sites.
