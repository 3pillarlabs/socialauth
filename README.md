Socialauth [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3pillarlabs/socialauth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/3pillarlabs/socialauth)
================

SocialAuth is a Java library ( [Android](https://github.com/3pillarlabs/socialauth-android) version available) for you if your web application requires:

* Authenticating users through external oAuth providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MySpace, Salesforce, Yammer, Google Plus, Instagram as well as through OpenID providers like myopenid.com.
* Easy user registration. All you need to do is create a page where users can click on buttons for the above providers or other supported providers. Just call SocialAuth and you can get all their profile details.
* Importing contacts from networking sites.
