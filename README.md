FORKED version
==============

I strongly recommend you DON'T use this library. This is a heavily forked version of socialauth 4.5 ( https://github.com/3pillarlabs/socialauth ).


Problems with this library:
 - it has no tests, so touching anything is really dangerous
 - HTTP client is hard-coded, so not configurable.
