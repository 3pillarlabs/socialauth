SocialAuth is a Java library (.NET port & Android version available) for you if your web application requires: 

* Authenticating users through external oAuth providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MySpace, Salesforce, Yammer as well as through OpenID providers like myopenid.com. 
* Easy user registration. All you need to do is create a page where users can click on buttons for the above providers or other supported providers. Just call SocialAuth and you can get all their profile details.
